## mainly notes to me about vector.

From C and x change can get angle.

From angle and new C can get x and y changes.

Only necessary for the "compounded" version


need to keep Original version somewhere & "current" x.y


chance to move would be dnorm() based on original R.j
then randomly pick distance. Weighted?

for the "compounded" version, base next change off the updated x.y
so, will need to have a "movement" variable: no, temp, compounded
